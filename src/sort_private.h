/* TO STUDENTS:
 *
 *  This file is currently "empty".
 *  Here you can put the prototypes of auxiliary "private" functions that are
 *  internally used by "public" functions.
 *  For instance, you can declare the prototype of the function that performs
 *  the "merge" operation in the merge-sort algorithm:
 *    static void upo_merge_sort_merge(void *base, size_t lo, size_t mid, size_t hi, size_t size, upo_sort_comparator_t cmp);
 *  Also, you can declare the prototype of the function that performs the
 *  the recursion in the merge-sort algorithm:
 *    static void upo_merge_sort_rec(void *base, size_t lo, size_t hi, size_t size, upo_sort_comparator_t cmp);
 *  Further, you can declare the prototype of the function that performs the
 *  "partition" operation in the quick-sort algorithm:
 *    static size_t upo_quick_sort_partition(void *base, size_t lo, size_t hi, size_t size, upo_sort_comparator_t cmp);
 *  And so on.
